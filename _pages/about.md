I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Statistics at the Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile. My current research focuses on Bayesian statistics, particularly spatial-temporal and product partition models, statistical modeling/methods in public health and computational methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA).
