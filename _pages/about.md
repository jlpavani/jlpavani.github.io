I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. My current research focuses on Bayesian statistics, particularly spatial-temporal and product partition models, statistical modeling/methods in public health and computational methods, particularly Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA).
