I have recently completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at the [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/) and will be joining the [University of Calgary](https://ucalgary.ca/) as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow this winter. My current research focuses on Bayesian statistics, particularly spatial-temporal and product partition models. Furthermore, I am also interested in statistical modeling/methods in public health and computational methods, especially Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).
