I have recently completed my Ph.D. in the [Department of Statistics](http://mat.uc.cl/) at the [Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/). My current research focuses on Bayesian statistics, particularly spatial-temporal and product partition models. Furthermore, I am also interested in statistical modeling/methods in public health and computational methods, especially Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA).
